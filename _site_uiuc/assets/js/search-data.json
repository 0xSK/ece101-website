Roy Choudhury and Lumetta put this course together with the hope of helping students (from all departments) understand and ponder about modern technologies that have changed and will continue to change people’s lives in the coming decade. Shreyas is a senior ECE student with extensive experience on our course staff, who volunteered to join us for his passion for motivating non-engineers about STEM ideas. As you may already know, we have made some major changes to the course content and structure, so please ignore any old descriptions that you might find online—this page and our introductory lecture will tell you about the plans for this and coming semesters. If you have friends who you think might also be interested in joining our class, please encourage them to do so this semester (or next). We’re also interested in hearing how you learned about our class, as we do want to attract more students. As you know, the first week of classes must be online, and while we’re eager to meet you face-to-face, COVID is rampant in Champaign. We feel that continued online meetings are likely for some time. Sincerely, The ECE 101 Course Staff . ",
