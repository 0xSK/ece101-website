Shreyas is a senior ECE student with extensive experience on our course staff, who volunteered to join us for his passion for motivating non-engineers about STEM ideas.

If you have friends who you think might also be interested in joining our class, please encourage them to do so this semester (or next). Weâ€™re also interested in hearing how you learned about our class, as we do want to attract more students.
