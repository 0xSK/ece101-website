This semester, we will be offering two options to do your CS/ECE 434 MPs:

* Jupyter Notebooks (with Python3 code)
* MATLAB Source Code Files + a PDF with text responses and graphs

While you are free to choose between either version, I strongly encourage you to choose Jupyter Notebooks for your MPs. The Jupyter version of the MPs will contain everything in a single notebook, thus eliminating the need for you to mind-share across a PDF prompt, a programming environment and a submission document. This should lead to a better experience for the students and should reduce chances of errors.

Here is a detailed comparison matrix between the two options, for your reference:

| Option          | Projected Stock Value | Mental State while doing MP | Social Perception |
|-----------------|:---------------------:|:---------------------------:|:-----------------:|
| Jupyter/Python3 | 📈                    | 🧠 👨‍🎓️                   | 😎                |
| MATLAB          | 📉                    | 🤒 🤢 🤮                    | 🧓🏼              |


I will be conducting an optional beginner-friendly session to help you get sufficiently familiar with Python3 and Jupyter to do well on your MPs (and beyond). The tentative plan is to cover the following in about 60-90 minutes:

1. Introduction to Python and its syntax
1. Installation and usage of Jupyter Notebooks
1. Installation and walkthrough of common Python modules such as as numpy, matplotlib and pandas
1. If you are interested, please [fill in your availability (this Friday-Sunday) here](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.when2meet.com/?11020167-m9zci__;!!DZ3fjg!sY7P8PG1sAg6HpFy_6MjuoCrf8mc4PBN65AQqJIOusQgYgCjcT5PIyoqLXYmgIOaV4o$) asap. I will pick a time that works best for all of us, and will send you another email later today with more details. The session will be recorded and posted to the course website.
