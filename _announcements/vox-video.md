As Prof. Romit pointed out, Vox has an explainer on YouTube explaining how the internet works. I encourage you to watch it here: [https://youtu.be/TNQsmPf24go](https://youtu.be/TNQsmPf24go). You would already know most of the ideas from that video, but it's still entertaining to watch and it should help reinforce certain concepts.
