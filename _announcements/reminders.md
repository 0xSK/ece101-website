I hope you're as excited about this new semester as I am. Before we get started, here is a quick list of reminders:

* Our first lecture will be tomorrow, Jan 19th, from 11:00am to 11:50am Central Time on Zoom. You can join using [this link](https://illinois.zoom.us/j/89291413832?pwd=TTlrdktPVGxFUFVWaVA3bDRjRVM4dz09), or using: <br/>
  Meeting ID: `892 9141 3832` <br/>
  Password: `269962`
* **Please make sure your Zoom app is updated ([download link](https://zoom.us/download)).** People have had trouble this semester attending classes with older versions of Zoom.
* We will use Slack for discussion and questions. Please use [this invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/ece101workspace/shared_invite/zt-116g8erhf-Q3zZxDL6eUDxuAe5CkP6vA) to add yourself to our Slack workspace. I suggest using your university email or university Google account to sign up for Slack. Please let me know if you have any trouble.
* I suggest having a look at (and bookmarking) [the course website](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ece101/sp2022/). It has all information, announcements, and links you'd need about this course. We have also uploaded the slides for the first couple of lectures (if you'd want to have a look); you can find them in the course calendar on the website.

I hope you have a great start to your semester. See you all soon!
